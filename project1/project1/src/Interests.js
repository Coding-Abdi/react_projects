These little creatures have kept an official record of everyone brave enough to clamber atop me since 1953 - the number stands at 6,338 people. But I have existed for aeons - 60 million years to be precise. Countless of these little creatures have visited me - their ancestors have forgotten them but I remember them all!</p>
