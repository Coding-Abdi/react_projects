            <p>My main interest is marvelling at the little creatures that have the courage to climb up my jagged face. These little creatures have kept an official record of everyone brave enough to clamber atop me since 1953 - the number stands at 6,338 people. But I have existed for aeons - 60 million years to be precise. Countless of these little creatures have visited me - their ancestors have forgotten them but I remember them all!</p>
