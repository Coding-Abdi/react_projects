        description1: "Mount Fuji, or Fujisan as the Japanese call it, is located on Japan's largest island of Honshu. It has an elevation of 3,776m / 12,389ft and is Japan's tallest peak. It is a dormant volcano with the last eruption taking place in 1707.",
        description2: "Mt. Fuji is arguably the most perfect volcanic cone in existence and is often portrayed in art, literature, and religion. Unlike other famous high-elevation mountains in the world, Mt. Fuji is not part of a large mountain range. It stands alone, in all its magnificence.",
        description3: "Mt. Fuji's significance to Japan began with the Shinto religion who believed a deity lived in the crater. Pilgrimages were made to the summit and the crater in honor of the deity. As the pilgrimages started to grow in popularity, organizations began to support the increasing amount of travelers on the mountain. Trails were designated, mountain huts established, shrines built, and the rest is history. Along with Mt. Tate and Mt. Haku, Mt. Fuji is one of the three holiest mountains in the country. Today, Mt. Fuji is an important symbol in Japan and a UNESCO Cultural World Heritage Site. Its beauty is enjoyed by many people all around the world.",

        description1: "The Sydney Opera House is a performing arts centre on the bank of Sydney Harbour in Australia. Opened in 1973, it's acknowledged as one of the 20th century's most famous and distinctive buildings. The building takes up the whole of Bennelong Point - a partly man-made promontory. The structure is close to Sydney's central business district and the city's Royal Botanic Gardens.",
        description2: "Despite its name, the building isn't a single venue. As well as a 2,679-seat concert hall, it also has 3 main theatres: the Joan Sutherland theatre (1,507 seats), the Drama theatre (544 seats) and the Playhouse (398 seats). There's also a studio theatre with 280 fixed seats.",
        description3: "The venue also has a space for smaller productions – the Utzon room, named after the building's architect Jørn Utzon. Other facilities include an open air forecourt for outdoor productions as well as restaurants, cafes and bars. The opera house sees over 1,500 performances every year, attended by more than 1.2 million people. More than 8 million people visit the building annually with 350,000 taking a guided tour of the building. The venue has 3 resident companies: Opera Australia, the Sydney Theatre Company and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.",

        description1: "The Geirangerfjord is an arm of a larger fjord system that extends all the way to Ålesund. The fjord reaches a depth of 260 metres, while the steep mountains surrounding it rise to 1600-1700 metres above sea level.",
        description2: "Together with Nærøyfjorden, the Geirangerfjord and its surrounding area represent the western Norwegian fjord landscape on UNESCO's exclusive World Heritage List. The reason why the Geirangerfjord is included on this list is due to its exceptional natural landscape, including waterfalls, steep mountains, unique natural phenomena, and both terrestrial and underwater wildlife.",
        description3: "Along the fjord, one can observe traces of farms high up on the steep mountainsides. Although all the farms have been abandoned, many have been restored and serve as important cultural heritage sites, providing insights into the local way of life. From the village of Geiranger, you can take a boat to Skagehola and hike up the steep trail to Skageflå, which is the most famous of the farms. From there, you will be treated to a breathtaking view of the fjord and its numerous waterfalls. The most famous one is 'The Seven Sisters' waterfall.",
